# Cycloud

## Getting started

Requirements:

-   Node.js
-   A MongoDB server running somewhere

To get the application running locally, you have to:

-   clone this repo
-   `npm install` to install the dependencies
-   set the environment variables by creating a .env file in the main folder. Copy and paste all the content of .env_label inside it and replace the label values of the variables with your own values
-   run the front-end development server with `npm start` (port 3000)
-   run the back-end APIs server with `node ./backend/app.js` (port 3001)

## Functionality overview

It's a simple portfolio project. It is a web platform that allows the user to register and obtain storage space on the server. He can upload and download files of all types as if it were a real cloud service. At the moment there is no limitation in the storage space you have available.
